These are tests for stuff that can usually break between versions, either because 
of the complexity of the plugins and dependencies, or because of weird interactions
between them and/or the editors.

(gosh, I whish I could automate this)

- Installation
    Open editor (vim / nvim) for the first time and wait for installation.
    Close editor.
    Re open editor.
    Shouldn't raise any errors during the whole process.
- Fuzzy finder
    Find main.py file with `,e`
    Find another_function with `,g`
- Class browser
    Show with `F4`
- Autocompletion
    Open main.py and type `x.` at the end.
    Should show string methods.
- Go to definition
    Open main.py and go to the do_something call. Press `,d`.
    Should open a_lib.py and place yuo in the function.
- Errors and style
    Open main.py, add `x.foo()` at the end and save.
    Should see error on that line, and warnings of style on missing docstrings and x.
- Ack-grep code finder
    Be sure to be under /root, go to the do_something call. Press `,wr`
    Should list a bunch of files where it found "do_something".
